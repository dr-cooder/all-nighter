# The All-Nighter
## Premise
The Arduino breadbord setup is inside a miniature house, and the connected Unity application depicts a view inside the house. The state of the day/night cycle is interpreted by the photoresistor (daytime unless darker than a set threshold) and depicted on the display. If the displayed hard(ly)-working man in the house notices a change from day to night he will get up and turn the lights on, and if he notices a change from night to day he will turn the lights back off again. The state of the lights will also be portrayed by the physical house model through the windows via LED's.
